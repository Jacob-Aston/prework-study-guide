# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

 This webpage allowed me to apply code I was learning. It was built to keep note of what I learn as I prepare for the course. I now have a recourse to look back to and a coding platform to build apon. I learned the basics in setting up a website using several coding languages. Each language serving its specific purpose within the webpage.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
